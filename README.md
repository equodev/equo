## Framework Core

Equo Framework is divided in different projects. The current one is the Framework Core, which is the essential one to run Equo apps.
The core provides:
* App structure and fluent API to build an app
* Contributions support for each bundle to contribute resources into the app (as css or js scripts)
* Equo server and proxy to add custom resources into the app
* Equo websockets to stablish a two-way communication between Java and Javascript

## Developing the Equo Framework

For developing the Equo Framework follow the [Equo Framework development guide](https://gitlab.com/maketechnology/equo/framework/wikis/Equo-Framework-Development-Guide).
